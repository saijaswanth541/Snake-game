# Snake-game

Snake is a classic game dating back to 1976. It has since been remade hundreds of times with the most famous probably being the versions featured in the Nokia mobile phones since -98. 

The player starts as a small snake, often no more than a block, and the goal is to eat in order to grow. For each fruit eaten the snake controlled by the player grows by one block. If the player should steer the snake into itself or into a wall the game is over. Different Snake versions count the score differently.
